<h3>Task 1: Verify Firewall Status for Each Network Profile</h3>
First, I clicked on the Windows Start button and navigated to Windows Security. Once there, I located and click on 'Firewall & network protection.'
Then I made sure to click on each network profile - Domain, Private, and Public - and I ensured that the Windows Defender Firewall was toggled to 'On' for each one.

<h3>Task 2: Allow Firefox through Firewall</h3>
Let's make an exception for Mozilla Firefox. I clicked on 'Allow an app through firewall' and locate Firefox in the list. I noticed that it's allowed on the Private network but blocked on the Public network. To rectify this, I simply checked the box next to 'Public' for Firefox. Once done, I hit 'OK' to return to the Firewall & network protection screen.
